# Slack Connect App - Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified:
- [x] Database tables not initialized (empty slack.db file)
- [x] Missing .env file (only .env.example exists)
- [x] Backend server binding to localhost instead of 0.0.0.0
- [x] Frontend hardcoded to localhost:4000 (won't work in production)
- [x] Missing database initialization in the backend startup
- [x] No error handling for database connection issues
- [ ] Missing token refresh logic implementation
- [x] No proper channel fetching from Slack API

## Fixes Implemented:

- [x] Added database initialization on startup
- [x] Updated server to bind to 0.0.0.0

## Test Results:
- [x] Backend server starts successfully on port 4000

## Remaining Issues:
